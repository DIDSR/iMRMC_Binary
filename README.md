<h3>iMRMC_Binary</h3>

iMRMC_Binary is a software package for simulating, sizing, and analyzing a multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) reader study with binary assessments (e.g., whether a readerâ€™s assessment of a patient case agrees with a reference standard). The software allows generating MRMC datasets (binary reader assessment scores) that have the user-specified correlation structure (or variance components) that exists in real-world MRMC studies. The package also has a function that uses simulated datasets to validate an analysis method (i.e., examine the empirical coverage probability of the confidence interval estimated by an analysis method). The software also does Monte Carlo based power calculation that can be applied to any analysis method. The current version of the software assumes a fully-cross design, ie, every reader reads every case of both modalities. The documentation (user manual) has a description of the simulation model, the use of the model for validation and sizing, and literature related to MRMC analysis and study designs. The software can run under both Matlab and Octave (free version of Matlab).
